# What is Xedit

Xedit is an Open Sourced IDE for macOS. It is heavily inspired by Xcode and CodeEdit. The goal of Xedit is to provide powerful tools like Xcode but to support a larger range of languages and provide tools for cross-platform development to target other machines that are not Apple-related.

# Why Xedit

Most IDEs are Windows/Linux only or do not look that good on macOS. It is time for a new age of IDE development where the software will look as modern and be as powerful as the default tool provided by Apple (Xcode). Applications like Visual Studio Code, JetBrains, Sublime Text, etc., are good, but they do not utilize the full potential of Apple APIs. This IDE is purely built on Apple tools. It will utilize all the potential power your system has to offer to provide the ultimate development service tailored to your needs.

# Release Date

It is too early to provide a confirmed release date for Xedit. Once Xedit has basic functionality, a release date will be announced.
